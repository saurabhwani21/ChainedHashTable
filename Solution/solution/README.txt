The following is a brief description of the test cases written:

1. Adding large number of key-value pairs as compared to the capacity 
   of the hash table. 
   In this case the initial capacity of the hash table is 10, which 
   increases when 2000 key-value pairs are added. 
2. Try to add a null key in the hash table. 
3. Insert 5 key-value pairs and try to get all of them (printing them 
   on the console).
4. Check what happens if the hash table is checked for a key is has 
   i.e. valid key and if the hash table is checked for a key it does 
   not have i.e. invalid key. 
5. Try to get the value of a key which does not exist in the current 
   hash table. 
6. Try to create a new hash table with a capacity not greater than zero. 
7. Try to create a new hash table with a load threshold value not 
   greater than zero.
